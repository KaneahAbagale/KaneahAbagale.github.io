<!--Second paragraph-About my year-->
    <p>
       The year begun a good note, with a new job, relocating and getting to spend more time with my sisters.<br/>
       My new job as a cabin crew was amazing because I got the opportunity to embark on a new career journey. Not even the licencial or stressful six week intensive training could steal this joy.<br/>
       I official started flying on the 6th of January and it was amazing.
